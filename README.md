# Tutorials: Feature Engineering in Python
[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/rasgointelligence/feature-engineering-tutorials/main)

This repository contains tutorials and code to enable data scientists to easily create new features and evaluate their importance for supervised machine learning. 

At Rasgo, we're data scientists, and we're really interested in the problem of feature engineering and everything that leads to that. We wrestle with these types of problems all the time and thought we'd capture examples of recipes for how to use some of the best tools available in this space. We're also working on our own SDK for feature engineering and want to provide a place to showcase new features as they are ready for testing. We hope you find this repo useful. Please let us know if there are other examples you'd like to see us include either by filing issues or pinging us on our Slack.

Please join us on the [Rasgo User Group Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rasgousergroup/shared_invite/zt-nytkq6np-ANEJvbUSbT2Gkvc8JICp3g) to ask questions regarding these recipes.
