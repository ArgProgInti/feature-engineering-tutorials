# Tutorials: Feature Engineering in Python

This repository contains tutorials and code to enable data scientists to easily create new features and evaluate their importance for supervised machine learning.

Please join us on the [Rasgo User Group Slack] to ask questions regarding these recipes.

Please suggest additional tutorials you would like to see by filing issues or pinging us on our Slack.
